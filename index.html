            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Born and raised in Iowa (corn state), I studied at the University of Iowa for two years before transferring. I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in upstate New York, and later went back for my M.B.A.
              <br><br>When Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy reading, cooking/eating (foodie for life!), and learning new languages for my travels around the world. I love to meet new people and learn new things, so please feel free to say hello and connect with me on LinkedIn!
              <br><br>I am very passionate about bringing people together, especially by breaking down communication and cultural barriers, which led me to interpreting. I decided to pursue marketing for a more active role in decision-making, as interpreters have to be neutral participants. Along the way, I picked up some technical skills to allow me to build this website, and I'm still learning and experimenting!

            <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
            <p>Since relocating, I have been interpreting courses at the various locations of the San Diego Community College District.
              <br><br>In Rochester, I was a part-time social media manager at Soul Juicin, working with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.
              <br><br>While in grad school and working at Soul Juicin, I also worked full-time at RIT as an interpreter on the science/engineering team.
              <br><br>Once I graduated from undergrad, I interpreted as a freelancer before being hired at RIT.
              <br><br>While studying at RIT, I became student manager of Artesano Cafe, then worked as a student interpreter and scheduler.
              <br><br>For detailed information and skills, please look at my LinkedIn.
