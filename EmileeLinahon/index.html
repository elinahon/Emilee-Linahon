            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Born and raised in Iowa (corn state), I studied at the University of Iowa for two years before transferring. I graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in upstate New York, and later went back for my M.B.A.
              <br><br>When Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy reading, cooking/eating (foodie for life!), and learning new languages for my travels around the world. I love to meet new people and learn new things, so please feel free to say hello and connect with me on LinkedIn!
              <br><br>I am very passionate about bringing people together, especially by breaking down communication and cultural barriers, which led me to interpreting. I decided to pursue a more hands-on role (is this a pun?), as interpreters have to be neutral participants in the situations they interpret. I learned MySQL first while in graduate school, and I loved the way it made me feel (like a wizard!). I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which allowed me to build this website from scratch. I realized that by learning web development, I could connect people via the internet instead. I'm still learning and experimenting, but I'm glad to have found another way to pursue my passion in life!

            <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
            <p>For detailed information and skills, please look at my LinkedIn (link provided on the left side of the page).
              <br><br>Since relocating to San Diego, I have been interpreting part-time while I work on my development skills. I have also been studying computer science topics such as algorithms, as well as learning to build applications using React and Android.
              <br><br>In Rochester, I was a part-time social media manager at Soul Juicin, working with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. I also worked as a data analyst to spot opportunities for business growth.
              <br><br>While in grad school and working at Soul Juicin, I also worked full-time at RIT as an interpreter on the science/engineering team.
              <br><br>Once I graduated from undergrad, I interpreted as a freelancer before being hired at RIT.
              <br><br>While studying at RIT, I became student manager of Artesano Cafe, then worked as a student interpreter and scheduler.
